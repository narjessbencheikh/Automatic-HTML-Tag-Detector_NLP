# Automatic HTML Tag Detector

The Automatic HTML Tag Detector project involves creating an intelligent system that identifies HTML tags and predicts Named Entity Recognition (NER) tags within a given text. This is achieved through a classification model that associates each entity with its relevant HTML and NER tags, ensuring accurate tagging for structured data extraction. Additionally, a dashboard is developed to provide a clear visualization of prediction results, enabling users to interactively view and analyze tag assignments and model performance.
